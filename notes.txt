Installing Jenkins on Localhost:
NOTE: For Jenkins, you gotta install Java first: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-on-ubuntu-20-04
Jenkins LocalHost Setup: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-jenkins-ubuntu
On Ubuntu: https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/

You can open it on localhost:8080

If you need to create a project, click 'new item'

Build History shows the status of the build

Manage Jenkins is where you can configure your system and global plugins

For this demo, we have a free style project

You can click build and build history to see the result

How to print environment variables: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40050793/how-to-print-echo-environment-variables

Jenkins exist because you want continuous integration with multiple developers. 
You can run tests every time you submit code. If the test failed, the test gets sent back to the 
developer and it allows the developer to see what's broken and fix it. They ALSO don't have to write 
tests locally on their computer.
So ideally, you'd want to build with Dev, then run jenkins to build that for Prod, (if it works and passess the tests)

Jenkins Pipeline:
Step 1: Commit Code 
Step 2: Build The Code
Step 3: Runs Tests; unit tests or additional tests
Step 4: Release
Step 5: Deploy/Deliver to production

Jenkins pulls code from a repository, builds code with Maven, then pushes the results. These test scripts then run 
,(sometimes in Maven/Selenium)
If you're testing a LOT of files, you'll need to create differnt Jenkins serves to test that
The Jenkins Master node send different build versions to Jenkins Slave nodes

Jenkins Settings:
Look at email settings this dude set, preety basic
Make sure your 'use less secure apps' setting is turned onhttps://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?p=lsa_blocked&hl=en&visit_id=637560087533405556-335181732&rd=1#zippy=%2Cif-less-secure-app-access-is-on-for-your-account

Global Tool Configuration
You need to put in all the tools you'll need for building code...Jenkins dosen't know what is building!

Configure Security
You can set up LDAP and all kinds of stuff for maintaing User access
Typically, Jenkins stores access in a file system
You can schedule jobs to run from within jenkins...need to remember some cron tools to do so
We did so under 'build periodically'

You can run Jenkins jobs externally as well outside of Jenkins. You need to create credentials for it
For example, go to plugin manager and search with this: Role-based Authorization Strategy

In order to connect your containers and such with jenkins, you need to go install some plug ins
