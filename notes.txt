Jenkins exist because you want continuous integration with multiple developers. 
You can run tests every time you submit code. If the test failed, the test gets sent back to the 
developer and it allows the developer to see what's broken and fix it. They ALSO don't have to write 
tests locally on their computer.
So ideally, you'd want to build with Dev, then run jenkins to build that for Prod, (if it works and passess the tests)

Jenkins Pipeline:
Step 1: Commit Code 
Step 2: Build The Code
Step 3: Runs Tests; unit tests or additional tests
Step 4: Release
Step 5: Deploy/Deliver to production

Jenkins pulls code from a repository, builds code with Maven, then pushes the results. These test scripts then run 
,(sometimes in Maven/Selenium)
If you're testing a LOT of files, you'll need to create differnt Jenkins serves to test that
The Jenkins Master node send different build versions to Jenkins Slave nodes
